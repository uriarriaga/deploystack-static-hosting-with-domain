Clicking this link will take you right to the DeployStack app, running in your 
Cloud Shell environment. It will walk you through setting up your architecture.  

## Cleanup 
To remove all billing components from the project
1. Typing `deploystack uninstall`

**NOTE:** This will only clean up the infrastructure;  buying a domain is permanent
and non-reversable. 

## Testing
If you want to modify the script and test you have to jump through a few hoops. 
Also, the script can work against domains you've already purchased with Cloud
Domains. So do that first - then setup testing. 

1. Create a dedicated Google Cloud Project for Domain
1. Obtain domain with Cloud Domains
1. Verify the domain with using [Google Webmaster Central](https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home)
1. Add your Cloud Build Service Account as an owner of that account. 
1. Set an environmental variable `$APPINABOX_YESORNOSITE_DOMAIN` to be the domain you reserved.

* Run in bash:
```bash
./test
```
* Run in Cloud Build
```bash
gcloud builds submit --substitutions=_APPINABOX_YESORNOSITE_DOMAIN=$APPINABOX_YESORNOSITE_DOMAIN --config=test.yaml .
```
